        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Last Updated: October 2024
            <br><br>
            This Privacy Policy applies to the personal data processed by Sugar.no app (“Sugar.no” or "we") in relation to the users of Sugar.no’s platform, mobile application ("App"), website, and any associated services or products (collectively, the "Sugar.no Services"). It also applies to personal data processed by Sugar.no regarding the representatives of our vendors, business partners, and customer organisations, including data processed within our CRM database and related to direct marketing activities. The individuals covered by this policy are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Users" or "you."
            <br><br>
            If you have any questions regarding how we process your personal data or if you wish to exercise any of your rights, including accessing or erasing your data, please contact our Data Protection Officer ("DPO") at t.
            <br><br>
            This Privacy Policy only applies to data processing carried out by Sugar.no as a data controller. We are not responsible for the privacy and data processing practices of any third parties. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information on how they handle your data.
            <br><br>
            The controller for all personal data processed through the Sugar.no Services is:<br>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            What Data We Collect and Why
            <br><br>
            We collect and process data to provide and improve the Sugar.no Services, including the Sugar.no App. We also collect user data to enable payment processing and for marketing purposes, such as sending you offers and updates about our products and services. The types of data we collect are grouped into two main categories:
            <br><br>
            Default Data: This includes essential information necessary to provide the Sugar.no Services, such as personal data related to your purchases, account creation, and app usage. The legal basis for processing this data is the performance of the contract between you and Sugar.no. We may also process this data based on our legitimate interest in maintaining the security and integrity of the Sugar.no Services, as well as for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims related to your use of our services. Additionally, we may process Default Data for direct marketing purposes, based on your explicit consent, which you can withdraw at any time.
            <br><br>
            Optional Data: This includes information that enhances your experience of the Sugar.no App, such as dietary preferences, height, weight, and health-related metrics. Some features may not function as intended without certain Optional Data (e.g., logging meals in the app). The legal basis for processing Optional Data is either the performance of a contract or our legitimate interest in improving the Sugar.no Services. If the data includes health-related information, we will rely on your explicit consent for processing.
            Health Data
            <br><br>
            To function properly, the Sugar.no App requires access to certain health-related data, such as glucose levels from your Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), dietary information, and other optional health metrics like BMI and heart rate. The legal basis for processing this sensitive data is your explicit consent, which you can revoke at any time through the app or by contacting us directly.
            <br><br>
            For research and development purposes, we may de-identify your health data to protect your privacy. De-identified data means that all personal identifiers have been removed, making it impossible to link the data back to you. However, pseudonymised data, which still allows for indirect identification, is treated as personal data and protected under this Privacy Policy.
